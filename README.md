 # Intro
 
A small Python program that will evolve over time (when I have some) to chat locally with GPT-2.
It is based on the GPT-2 model developed in this library; 
 
 https://github.com/huggingface/transformers
 
To use it you need the complete library so :
 
 ```
 pip install transformers
 ```

You will also need to change the paths to yours in the python file.
 
This script also works for GPT-3 if you have access to the required libraries.
 
 ## TODO
 
 For the future of this repository, there are many things to do:
 
- [ ] 1. revise unnecessary elements such as the save option.

- [ ] 12. Redesign of the current frontend which is badly broken down.

- [ ] 31. Adding loading bars, ...

- [ ] 5. Audio playback for texts

- [ ] 28. Creation of an .exe file
      
  . . .
